# subproc
Launch and run a sub-process.

## Setup
You can install cmake and run:
```
$ sh install.sh
```
then
```
$ sh run.sh
```
to see things working. After you run the program, you can find two files in ```bin/output/``` where the subprocess may have output information.
Alternatively, you can find the source files in the ```src/``` directory and extract them to use elsewhere.

In ```src/main.c``` you can see that I have made the program run the ```ls``` command. You can change that!
