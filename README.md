# subproc
Run a sub-process.

## Setup
### Option 1:
You need `cmake` installed to run `compile.sh`. On debian, for example, you can install `cmake` by running:
```
apt install cmake
```
After cmake is installed, run:
```
./compile.sh
```
then
```
./run.sh
```
to run the example `main.c`.

After you run the program, you can find two files in `output/` where `ls` (the command run in the example) may have output information.

### Option 2:
Alternatively, you can find the source files in the `src/` directory and extract them to use in your own way.
