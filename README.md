# subproc
Launch and run a sub-process.

## Setup
You can install cmake and run:
```
./compile.sh
```
then
```
./run.sh
```
to see things working. 

After you run the program, you can find two files in ```output/``` where the subprocess may have output information.

Alternatively, you can find the source files in the ```src/``` directory and extract them to use in your own way.

In ```src/main.c``` you can see that I have made the program run the `ls` command.
